### **PacMan Assignment** <br>
The goal of this exercise was to code the trajectory of PacMan on the x-axis and set a time interval for the animation.
<br>
### **Description**<br>
By using the function, setInterval (Run, 200) on line 34, I was able to call the function to run every 200 milliseconds. Lines 43-44 detail the direction on the x-axis of the 2 Pacman images. They run in an alternating sequence with set parameters.
<br>
### **Usage**<br>
This code can be used to practice running an animation at a set interval (speed / direction). This can be used as the foundation for those looking to develop a game.
